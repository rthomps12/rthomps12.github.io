**Grant Alert!** 

The Thompson group is excited to announce that 
they have been awarded a research grant through 
the American Chemical Society's Petroleum Research Fund. 

The research project, set to take place between 2023 and 2025, will explore the aggregation of complex organic molecules in alkane mixtures representative of heavy crude oil. We will represent these mixtures using SAMs and our 
expertise with surface-sensitive spectroscopy.
