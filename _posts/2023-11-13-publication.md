The Thompson group's publication entitled, "Protein Adsorption on Mixed Self-Assembled Monolayers: Influence of Chain Length and Terminal Group" has 
been accepted for publication in the ACS Journal, *Langmuir*. 

This paper is the culmination of our recent work looking at the impact of 
mixed SAMs on weak protein adsorption. Huge congratulations to the four 
students that worked on this and are listed as co-authors: Alyssa Havens,
Emily El-Shaer, Lili Garcia, and John Godino.
