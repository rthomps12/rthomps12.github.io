## Course Description
Why do frozen water pipes rupture in the winter? What is an atomic clock and
how does it help us keep time? Why does table salt dissolve in water? How does bleach remove stains
from your carpet? To answer these questions, we must build a fundamental picture of light, matter and the
small particles (atoms) that make up our world. With these tools, students will construct a molecular-level
understanding of chemical bonding, reactivity, and thermodynamics.

## Student Learning Objectives
1. *Atoms and Molecules*: Develop a working understanding of the subatomic composition of elements and elemental composition of molecules
* [1.1 - Atoms](/1340/1.1/)
* [1.2 - Compounds](/1340/1.2/)
2. *Reactivity*: Describe the general composition and reactivity of matter
* [2.1 - Chemical Reactions](/1340/2.1/)
* [2.2 - Solutions](/1340/2.2/)
3. *Intramolecular Forces*: Describe the electronic properties of elements and use it to predict trends in bonding and molecular structure. 
* [3.1 - Electronic Structure](/1340/3.1/)
* [3.2 - Bond Energy](/1340/3.2/)
* [3.3 - Molecular Bonding](/1340/3.3/)
* [3.4 - Molecular Structure](/1340/3.4/)
4. *Intermolecular and Reaction Forces*: Describe the interactions between molecules that lead to bulk changes in chemical or physical properties. 
* [4.1 - Intermolecular Forces](/1340/4.1/)
* [4.2 - Reaction Forces](/1340/4.2/)
