## :key: Key Concepts and Skills
* **Entropy**: Explain what entropy is and evaluate relative difference in entropy based on varying states of matter and varying temperatures.
* **Gibbs Free Energy**: Explain what positive, negative, or a zero value for (delta)G means for a chemical process. Apply the relationships between change in enthalpy, change in entropy, and temperature to understand the spontaneity of a chemical process.
* **Effect of Temperature on Spontaneity**: Given values for entropy and entropy determine if temperature can alter spontaneity and calculate the temperature at which spontaneity can change if applicable for a chemical process.
* **Entropy of Atom Combination**: Write an equation for atom combination and explain relative changes in entropy associated with the process.
