## Course Description
It is likely that everything you have learned in chemistry to date can be traced back
to the concepts in physical chemistry! Questions you may have had rolling around since general chemistry
might now get an answer. Where do those mysterious quantum numbers actually come from? What is
entropy? Why and how do molecules vibrate and rotate? And what is the deal with Schrodingerâ€™s cat?

In this class we will survey the foundational principles and systems in both thermodynamics and quantum
mechanics. Beginning with thermodynamics, we will learn how energy is transferred from one form to
another in bulk systems and how this can be used to understand and predict the behavior of matter. Then
we will transition to quantum mechanics and learn about the strange laws governing the smallest atoms and
subatomic particles.
