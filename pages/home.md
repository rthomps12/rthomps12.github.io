Students in the Thompson group study molecules that self-assemble (i.e. spontaneously organize in a single layer) on solid interfaces. These “functionalized surfaces” can be used to create biomedical devices, but ***only*** if we understand the impact that molecular-level disorder can have on their organization, sensitivity to relevant biomolecules, and reliability under environmental conditions. We use specialized spectroscopic techniques to observe these molecular assemblies in real time. Learn more about our research [here](/research)!
